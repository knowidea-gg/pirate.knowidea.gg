<h2 class="ui header">Level 2</h2>
<p>The next page has a nice little story for you. Can you decipher it?
  <br />
  <br />
  <strong><i>Delta</i></strong> is known by many names: Barky McLickerson, Snoopster, and Goldy Boi, but his friends call him the <strong><i>Alpha</i></strong>, not out
  of fear but out of respect. He has taught all the dogs who visit the <strong><i>Sierra Hotel</i></strong> how to be the best doggos.
  <br />
  <br />
  Life changed for <strong><i>Delta</i></strong> when he met <strong><i>Oscar</i></strong>, the Persian white cat with a black paw print on the back. The cat completely
  entranced the dog. The mannerisms, attitude and style were nothing like he had ever seen before. They started doing a
  strange <strong><i>Tango</i></strong> around each other.
  <br />
  <br />
  One Sunday morning, <strong><i>Delta</i></strong> finally found the courage to approach <strong><i>Oscar</i></strong>. Maybe ask for a date, a dance, maybe actually
  even <strong><i>Tango</i></strong>. <strong><i>Delta</i></strong> took a deep breath and exclaimed, "I've never met another <strong><i>Alpha</i></strong> in my life! Might I have the
  pleasure of introducing you to the best that <strong><i>Sierra Hotel</i></strong> offers?"
  <br />
  <br />
  What is the best that they offer?
