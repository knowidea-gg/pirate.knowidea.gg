<h2 class="ui header">Basic Level 2</h2>
<p>Here's a small story for you.
  <br />
  <br />
  Delta is known by many names: Barky McLickerson, Snoopster, and Goldy Boi, but his friends call him the Alpha, not out
  of fear but out of respect. He has taught all the dogs who visit the Sierra Hotel how to be the best doggos.
  <br />
  <br />
  Life changed for Delta when he met Oscar, the Persian white cat with a black paw print on the back. The cat completely
  entranced the dog. The mannerisms, attitude and style were nothing like he had ever seen before. They started doing a
  strange Tango around each other.
  <br />
  <br />
  One Sunday morning, Delta finally found the courage to approach Oscar. Maybe ask for a date, a dance, maybe actually
  even Tango. Delta took a deep breath and exclaimed, "I've never met another Alpha in my life! Might I have the
  pleasure of introducing you to the best that Sierra Hotel offers?"
  <br />
  <br />
  What is the best that they offer?
